## Project Description

AskThem - public dialogue with candidates for Congress and state government - a free & open-source (& open-data!) project of the 501(c)3 non-profit Participatory Politics Foundation

| Site Url        | Desired Features           | 
| ------------- |-------------| 
| [AskThem 2018](https://askthem2018.org)| - questions-and-answers with 2018 candidates for elected office <br>  | 

Goal: brochure site & lead acquisition (emails) for non-profit web app. Update value proposition for 2018 midterm elections. Recruit as many of the following as possible through simple email registration form: candidates to participate; media partners for marketing; issue groups for promoted campaigns; major donors for operating support; and potential micro-donors, towards a goal of 2,000 monthly supporters at minimum $5 / month. 

User story: from homepage above the fold, priority is to **convert on email subscriptions**. Enable visitor to select a type of affiliation: regular voter with a question, elected official, candidate for office, media partner, or issue organization. 

User testing should check whether five options are too many, too confusing - could cut down to three if needed, or try to clarify in email follow-up, though seems necessary to differentiate candidates from regular voters.

Towards converting on email input, above-the-fold design should emphasize AskThem's unique value for 2018 public dialogue and accountability. Consider design elements: a big bold claim, or possibly a testimonial from a non-profit Advisor.  

Scrolling down, second view should illustrate why a regular voter should care about AskThem. Potential impacts & likely outcomes of 2018 participation. Target audience research: what drives them to sign & share questions, is it public act of demanding an official response, or a personal issue, or a local community issue, or anti-establishment feelings, etc.

Below, links to learn more for value to candidates (and current elected officials) (at federal & state levels of gov't), as well as media partners (both regional newspapers and political bloggers) and issue groups. Showcase "verified" candidate page, with positive check-mark features, and screenshots of free embeddable HTML [question widgets](http://www.askthem.io/widgets/builder) - [example, on Russia investigation](http://www.participatorypolitics.org/trump-mueller-and-russia-investigation/) - for digital media partners and issue advocacy groups. 

Below, message about what assets exist so far, and what goals are through 2018. List accomplishments since 2014 & Adivsor community, outline scale of potential Q&A nationwide: 
 * 33 U.S. Senate races; 
 * 438 U.S. House races, 
 * 36 Gov. races; 
 * 6,066 state leg. races (82% of all).

* Midterm election turnout in 2014 of just 36.4% of eligible voters, lowest in 70 years, down from 41% in 2010.
  * Of non-voters, one-third are under 30 years old; 70% under 50. 
  * 43% are Hispanic, African American or other racial and ethnic minorities. 
  * 46% have family incomes less than $30,000; 54% have not attended college

Potential illustrations with additional email signup forms: testimonials from candidates, media, issue groups, and major / micro donor. Probably just a micro-donor. 

Closing view on scroll-down: links to more info: public nonprofit funding prospectus, official /about page on production site, contact info. Below, links to share on social media, incorporating creative call to action for share.
